# LLMs & grammar
This is the repository for bachelor thesis 'Studying Large Language Models' Capabilities of Judging Linguistic Acceptability on Russian Sentences'

The folder 'annotation' contains two files with annotated examples of explanations and corrections generated by YandexGPT and GigaChat. 

In the folder 'code' files with the code which was used to prompt three models can be found ('saiga.ipynb', 'yagpt.ipynb' and 'gigachat.ipynb'). In addition to it, there are notebooks with the code which was used for measuring the labels and categories predicted ('evaluation.ipynb') and for extracting samples of explanations and corrections to annotate ('sample.ipynb').

All the models' outputs can be found on the Google drive [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ug07nGQvPDVezqsag4MvM3fCX_E-FdZJ)
